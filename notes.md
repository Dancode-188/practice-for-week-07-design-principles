# Design Notes
## Instagram
- I like that they're guiding the users on the input that's expected and their choice of color
- I don't like that the sign-in/sign-up page on the desktop version is less consipicuous compared to the animations

## CraigsList
- The website lacks color and is difficult to navigate


## GitHub
- I like the choice of color, the typography and the accessibility

## Reddit
- I like the conspicuous search bar and don't like their choice of the menu icon

## PaulGraham
- I like their simplicity and accessibility
- I however don't like the positioning of the main cotent - it should be central

## Supreme
-Also like the simplicity and uniqueness in choice of background color, which doesn't hurt the eyes
